        <h4><strong>Doug Dohring</strong><span>Founder, Chairman & CEO</span></h4>
        <div class="divide10"></div>
        <p>Prior to founding Age of Learning in 2007, Doug Dohring was founder and CEO of NeoPets, Inc., the children’s entertainment company that built Neopets.com into a global phenomenon. By the time he sold NeoPets to Viacom in 2005, it was the #1 website in the world in time spent per user and page views per user. Doug’s experience convinced him that it was possible to create a product for children that was as engaging as NeoPets but completely dedicated to education—and Age of Learning was born. He assembled a curriculum team composed of teachers, curriculum designers, and other experts in early childhood education, and after more than four years in development, launched ABCmouse.com Early Learning Academy in 2011. Today, ABCmouse.com is the leading online education resource for young children. It is loved by kids, trusted by parents, and relied upon by teachers. Learn more about Doug Dohring. </p>

        <h4><strong>Creative & Production Team</strong></h4>
        <div class="divide10"></div>
        <p>Prior to founding Age of Learning in 2007, Doug Dohring was founder and CEO of NeoPets, Inc., the children’s entertainment company that built Neopets.com into a global phenomenon. By the time he sold NeoPets to Viacom in 2005, it was the #1 website in the world in time spent per user and page views per user. Doug’s experience convinced him that it was possible to create a product for children that was as engaging as NeoPets but completely dedicated to education—and Age of Learning was born. He assembled a curriculum team composed of teachers, curriculum designers, and other experts in early childhood education, and after more than four years in development, launched ABCmouse.com Early Learning Academy in 2011. Today, ABCmouse.com is the leading online education resource for young children. It is loved by kids, trusted by parents, and relied upon by teachers. Learn more about Doug Dohring. </p>
